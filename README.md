## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **AES-256 Encryption** for strong file and folder security.
- 🧾 **SHA-256 Hashing** for file integrity verification.
- 📂 Supports both **single file** and **entire folder** encryption/decryption.
- 🎯 **Drag-and-drop** functionality.
- 🧑‍💻 Clean and modern **dark-themed GUI** (PyQt5).
- 📁 Auto-organizes encrypted files into a `files/` directory.
- 🖼️ Social icons for developer contact (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram).
- 💬 Password-based protection (input at encryption/decryption time).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Installation (for developers)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SecureFileStorageSystem.git
cd SecureFileStorageSystem
```

##💡 How It Works

Encrypt File/Folder → Select a file/folder → Enter password → Encrypted file is saved with .enc extension.
Decrypt File/Folder → Select .enc file → Enter correct password → Original file is restored.
Hashing → Ensures tamper detection during decryption using SHA-256.
Drag-and-Drop → Instantly encrypt files dropped into the app window.
